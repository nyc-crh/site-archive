questions:
  - What does it mean that Mrs. Cisco "rests her case solely on the fact that her children were refused admission to the common school on account of their color"? 
  - Is Mrs. Cisco arguing that the segregated schools for Black children are inferior, or that she opposes the rejection of her children because they are Black?
  - In 1896, the US Supreme Court declared that segregation was legal, as long as each group received equal services. This idea of “separate but equal” appears (in different words) in the Cisco case. What do you think Mrs. Cisco thought of this legal ruling?

Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco pushed for years for desegregation of the local Jamaica schools. Her first tactic was to try to enroll her children in segregated white institutions. She would then refuse to send them to segregated Black schools when they were turned away from the white schools. After trying this plan for years, Mrs. Cisco brought suit against the school board of Queens for violating the state’s education law. She and her husband had been activists, but her husband passed away in 1897. This left Mrs. Cisco to carry their work forward with the help of her attorneys.[^1]
Neither of the courts that heard the case settled in support of Mrs. Cisco. Both courts agreed with her that the school’s principal, on the orders of the district's superintendent, had prohibited her children's enrollment in the school closest to their home because it was a segregated white school and the Cisco children were Black. They ruled, however, that this was not a violation of the law since New York State had a law permitting school segregation. Mrs. Cisco lost her case. 
However, by filing the case, Mrs. Cisco had drawn attention to continued legal segregation in New York State, well after New York City’s schools had ended the policy in 1883. New York’s governor Theodore Roosevelt and his allies worked to change the law. In April 1950 the “The Elsberg Bill” was passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor. The bill read “no person shall be refused admission into or be excluded from any public school in the state of New York on account of race or color.[^2]
