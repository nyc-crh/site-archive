questions:
  - What are the different tactics and policies deployed the city officials to sustain segregation?
  - In the document, the NAACP puts the word “bussing” in quotation marks. Why do they do that? How does the issue of “bussing” obscure the realities of segregation?
  - How does “bussing” reflect the racial innocence espoused by white liberalism? What challenges did this language and these ideas pose to the NAACP’s organizing efforts?

The NAACP, like the Parents’ Workshop, played an important role in organizing the 1964 boycott. In this document the NAACP describes the efforts undertaken by Black New Yorkers to desegregate schools in resistance to the city officials and white residents who wanted to maintain that segregation.
