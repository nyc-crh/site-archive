Ella Baker was an influential organizer in struggles against segregated schools, police brutality, voting restrictions, and more. She pushed for freedom. Baker saw the pursuit of liberation as a collective effort, and she valued the views and passions of young people. As Barbara Ransby put it in her powerful biography on Ella Baker, Baker believed “people had many of the answers within themselves; teachers and leaders simply had to facilitate the process of tapping and framing that knowledge, of drawing it out . . . Baker’s pedagogy was democratic and reciprocal . . . her view of teaching for liberation was based on the need to empower ordinary people to dig within themselves and their collective experiences for the answers to social and political questions. She did not want her students to see her as the repository of all knowledge but to discover their own insights and knowledge base.”[^1]
Ella Baker, who moved to New York after graduating from Shaw University, became deeply involved in the struggle to desegregate New York City’s schools.[^2] In line with her view of movement building and democratic action, she worked with parents and young people to define their terms of their own struggle and coordinate campaigns for change. This questionnaire distributed to parents and students to use with their own schools reflects that commitment to grassroots activism and illustrates Baker’s organizing strategies in practice.
