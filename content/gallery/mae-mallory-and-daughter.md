During the "Harlem Nine's" struggle to integrate schools in New York City, multiple newspapers, including the New York Times and Amsterdam News, published photographs of Mae Mallory with her daughter Patricia. These images accompanied articles narrating the legal struggles of Mallory and the other Harlem mothers charged with violating the state’s truancy law. In some ways, she and her daughter became the face of the "Harlem Nine."[^1] While Mae Mallory may have consented to these photos, we might wonder how Patricia felt about her inclusion in the images and how she thought about and felt about the boycott.
