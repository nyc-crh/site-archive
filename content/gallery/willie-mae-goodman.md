Willie Mae Goodman, a Black woman, was a mother, wife, and food service worker living in East Harlem. Her daughter Marguerite was born with physical and intellectual disabilities. By the time Marguerite was 4, Mr. and Mrs. Goodman decided to listen to the doctors who suggested that she could learn more if she were in an institution. They sent her to Willowbrook State School, on Staten Island. Willowbrook, like many other  institutions for disabled people at the time, was a horrible place, more a warehouse than a school or the warm home that Marguerite deserved. The facilities at Willowbrook worried Mrs. Goodman - they were overcrowded and unsafe, a space that Senator Robert F. Kennedy, when he visited, described as “not fit for animals to live.”
After this criticism, officials who ran Willowbrook decided to move some patients out, to relieve the overcrowding. They moved Marguerite and about 200 other disabled people from Willowbrook to another former hospital on the Lower East Side, on Water Street. It was called Gouverneur Hospital. But they did not tell Mrs. Goodman, who arrived at Willowbrook to see her daughter, and was told that she was not there. As she recalled, it was  “heartbreaking for someone to send your child somewhere and not tell you where she is.”
Mrs. Goodman organized to help make Marguerite’s life better at her new location. She pushed the hospital to let her see Marguerite in her living space, rather than only in the impersonal lobby. She noticed and contested the unsafe parts of the facility and urged repair. Marguerite kept living, and then the state cut the budget. Administrators planned to send Marguerite back to Willowbrook. Now they said that it was OK, because Marguerite and the other residents would only live another 6 months.
Mrs. Goodman formed a parent’s association. They went to court - three times - to stop the transfer of her child back to Willowbrook. They forged alliances with the Black Panthers and the Young Lords, Black and Puerto Rican nationalist groups who had been advocating for health care and education in their communities - showed up at the hospital to keep residents from being put on buses for the transfer to Willowbrook.
And ultimately, they won. Marguerite was not sent back to Willowbrook. And within a few years, the city closed Willowbrook, and moved its former residents to smaller facilities closer to their parents and communities. Marguerite moved close to Mrs. Goodman in East Harlem. She is now 65.
Her mother Willie Mae Goodman continues to advocate for disabled people, including arguing that some of the new smaller homes are becoming “Little Willowbrooks” that are underfunded and impersonal.
