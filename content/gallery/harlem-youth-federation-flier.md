eventname: Harlem Youth Federation protests incarceration of the Harlem Five
caption: This is a flyer created by the Harlem Youth Federation to spread word about an upcoming protest against the incarceration of the Harlem Five (more famously known as the Harlem Six) in 1964. The policing and prosecution of six Black youth in Harlem for the alleged murder of white woman was another flashpoint in the hostile relationship between the New York Police Department and the neighborhood. The violence of the NYPD targeted at the Harlem Six, the racism apparent in the judicial process, and the media’s racist campaign against the youth resonated profoundly with Black youth in Harlem who lived under the same police “occupation” and racist criminal justice system.

The Harlem Six, like the Scottsboro Boys before them and the Central Park Five after them, show how racist policing and the criminal justice system ensnared Black youth in a violent web of oppression. [^1] William Craig, Ronald Fedler, Walter Thomas, and Robert Rice were all boys at the time of the initial incident. Wallace Baker and Daniel Hamm were just 19 and 18 years old. The precipitating incident occured when a fruit cart stand was knocked over on April 17, 1964. The ensuing chaos and whistle by the fruit stand owner drew the attention of a special police force that were tasked with street level crime. They sprang into action and began beating the children around the fruit stand. A number of adults intervened when they saw the police beating children, and were thus beaten themselves. Both Wallace Baker and Daniel Hamm suffered injuries from the police beating. The owner of the fruit stand told the police the adults had nothing to do with the attempted fruit robbery, they were only trying to protect the children from the police. 
On April 29, 1964 a white couple named Margit and Frank Sugar were stabbed in their used clothing store, which was was in the same neighborhood as the fruit cart incident had occurred. The police immediately rounded up six young men and boys who had been involved in the fruit stand incident. Wallace Baker, Daniel Ham, William Craig, Ronald Felder, Walter Thomas, and RObert Rice were all arrested. All six were charged with murder, despite evidence indicating only one knife had been used and the couple had each only been stabbed one time. 
While in prison awaiting trial, the Harlem Six were subject to more brutality. They were targets of the criminal justice system and were beaten in an attempt to elicit confessions. Two confessions that would later be ruled unconstitutional were entered into evidence. Police officers also submitted statements that would later turn out to be lies. The presiding judge denied the six the right to use their own lawyers and demanded they use state appointed defense attorneys. A jury convincted all six of murder.[^2]
James Baldwin later wrote that “No one in Harlem will ever believe the Harlem Six are guilty - God knows their guilt has certainly not been proved.” Indeed, little, if any, hard evidence existed that any of the six had been a party to the murder. Two unconstitutionally coerced confessions and police perjuries operated as evidence. The presiding judge denied the six the opportunity to select their own defense attorneys and mandated the use of court-appointed lawyers. The jury convicted the six. A later appeal successfully overturned the guilty verdicts and retrials were set for the following year. After seven years and three mistrials, the Harlem Six, now the Harlem Four because Rice and Hamm were being tried separately, were still fighting for their innocence and freedom. Baker, Craig, Felder, and Thomas eventually took a plea deal in 1973. They continued to proclaim their innocence, however, by pleading guilty to manslaughter they could end their incarceration and years of retrials. Daniel Hamm was eventually released in 1974. Robert Rice faced five more trials and seven appeals and remained in a prison in upstate New York and would not be released until 1991.[^3]
The injustices faced by the Harlem Six sparked protests, demonstrations, and mutual aid funds to support the young men incarcerated. Young people, like those who created and distributed this flyer, organized demonstrations because they saw themselves entrapped in the same racist criminal justice system as the Harlem Six. One thirteen year old taught a New York Times reporter that “I can’t help thinking that could be me . . . I’d be scared if I was up there like that. All those years waiting and wondering was going to happen to you.” Cheryl Samuels, thirteen-year-old cousin of Ronald Felder, wrote a letter explaining why she began passing “leaflets in court that a girl in [her] class made.” She wanted to “get the news around.
