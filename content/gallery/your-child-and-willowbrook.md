Early institutions for the "feeble-minded" (mid 1800s) were envisioned as educational institutions where children could be trained and returned to society to be productive citizens. Despite compulsory education laws which came about at the turn of the century, children with disabilities were often turned away from public schools, whose special education classes were understaffed and overcrowded. State institutions like Letchworth Village were built to take on the responsibility of educating children outside of New York City. Over time, and with less funding and greater demand, institutions opened throughout the country, with the highest concentration in New York. In October, 1947, Willowbrook, the largest state institution of its kind in the United States opened under the oversight of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene. The parents of children who were sent to institutions were often told by their physicians that an institution was the best place for their child. Families with greater financial means could choose to care for their disabled children at home rather than send them to an institution.
