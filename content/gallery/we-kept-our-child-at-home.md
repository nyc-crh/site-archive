After Willowbrook opened in 1947, demand for services steadily grew. During the decades leading up to the Willowbrook exposÃ©, the resident population grew at institutions in and around New York City. During this time period, physicians frequently told parents of "mentally retarded" children to send them to institutions where they could be rehabilitated. At the same time, public schools could still turn away children if they thought they were "uneducable." Children like Eddie, described by his father in this article, fell through the cracks. 
>Eddie is ten. He can't dress himself, tell time or play "hide and seek" like other kids. But he can repay love and affection. EIGHT YEARS AGO, when our son Eddie was two years old, doctors told us we would have to shut him up in an institution for retarded children. I usually take my time before making up my mind, but for once I didn't wait a split second before deciding good and loud, "Over my dead body!"We haven't put Eddie away. And even though at ten he's like a four-year-old, I'd say we're as happy a family as there is in the Borough of Queens in New York City where we live. I know you'll find that hard to believe when I tell you some of the things Eddie can't do and the things that he needs help with -- the help of my wife or myself.
>I don't think you could tell there is anything much wrong with Eddie just by looking at him. He's about four feet six, which isn't too small for his age. He weighs 58 pounds, about average for his build. He has nice white teeth and a straight nose. If you smile at him, he smiles right back. It's when Eddie moves around that you notice he's different. His wrists are kind of loose, and also, he can't control his left leg too well.About the only other outwardly abnormal thing about Eddie is his unusual restlessness. He moves around all the time and you can't get him to stop talking. Strangers often find it hard to follow what he's saying, but we understand him. It's usually something like wanting to go for a ride or asking for a drink of water -- anything a very young kid might jabber about. Sometimes it's hard to figure out if Eddie understands everything you say to him. But there's one thing sure: he's sensitive and his feelings get hurt. I think the main cause of these moments of misery is the fact that people don't understand about kids like him. Some of our neighbors seem to think he's a kind of monster who might do God-knows-what to their children. About a year ago, we heard Eddie screaming and rushed out in time to see a woman give him a shove that made him stagger. It turned out that she had warned her little daughter against going anywhere near Eddie; and when the child saw Eddie she very naturally cried out in fear and her mother rushed over to "protect her." A little later we had a visit from a truant officer who wanted to know why Eddie wasn't in school. It didn't take him long to realize Anna and I would have gone down on our knees to give thanks if Eddie could go to school.
