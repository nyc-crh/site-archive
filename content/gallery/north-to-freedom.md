This excerpted document (and the full document it is a part of) comes from the Ella Baker Papers collection at the Schomburg Center. It captures other important aspects of Ella Baker’s movement work. This proposal for a Freedom School in the North comes after Freedom Summer (1964) in Mississippi and school boycotts in New York, Boston, and Chicago. The structure of the document emphasizes students’ critical examination of why those boycotts took place, similarities between segregation in the South and the North, and the varied dimensions of racism experienced in places like New York. The series of questions and statements for reflection embodied Baker’s critical pedagogy, and it also challenged the pervasive idea that the North lacked the structural racism that defined life in the Jim Crow South. 
In the early part of the twentieth century, there was a “Great Migration,” often broken into the First (1910-1940) and Second (1945-1970) Migration, in which African Americans in the South moved to cities throughout the North. Black Americans seeking to escape the violent repression and limited economic opportunity of the Jim Crow South pursued industrial jobs in more prosperous Northern cities. Between 1915 and 1970, more than 6 million African-Americans moved from the South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West. However, in places like New York, many of those moving from the South quickly realized that northern schools were segregated and unequal, northern police departments deployed violence, employers discriminated on the basis of race, and real estate agents and landlords segregated neighborhoods in ways that subjected many African Americans to inferior housing conditions. While many of those who migrated saw improvements in their conditions, the racist structures of the North still reduced African Americans to second-class citizens.
One key difference between the South and the North was that white Northerners denied that racism existed in places like New York City. They argued that inequality in education, housing, and job market was not the product of racism but a result of individual choices and supposed cultural differences. Ignoring how practices such as redlining and gerrymandering of school districts (see Document Set How Do You Segregate a School System?) produced segregation and sustained inequality, white Northerners explained structural racism in individualized cultural and psychological terms. That is, they argued that institutions (e.g. schools, police, etc.) were “color-blind” and any racism was the product of one individual’s actions, rather than a structure or system. In this line of thinking, for instance, there was not segregation, but separation. There was not de jure segregation (segregation by law), but de facto segregation (by circumstance) in the North. White northerners shrouded their racism in a liberal politics that proclaimed innocence and the operation of “color-blind” institutions while denying the existence of ad devastation wrought by structural racism. 
For young people in New York, challenging segregation and inequality was a complicated task because white liberals denied that segregation existed and argued that inequality was the product of individual differences rather than racial discrimination. White liberals anchored their racism in cultural, rather than biological terms. They believed that Black youth and their families had been subjected to racism in the past and perhaps even been victims of a white individual’s racist taunts in the present, and these realities left a psychological scar which made Black youth predisposed to delinquent behavior and poorer school performance. Therefore, white liberals contended that inequalities in school performance were not because of the unequal distribution of resources through a segregated school system, but products of Black students. White liberals’ racism deepened inequality, and they wielded their racist ideas to deny structural racism. Thus, young people and their allies in New York challenging segregation and inequality had to work within a political system that denied the very structures which produced segregation and inequality.
