Denise Oliver, born in Brooklyn in 1947, grew up in Queens. Her father, George Bodine Oliver, was a drama professor, Tuskegee Airman, and one of the first Black actors to integrate Broadway in the 1940s. Her mother, Marjorie Roberts Oliver, taught at a high school in Queens. She was one of the few Black teachers in the entire city at that time.[^1] Eventually, Denise Oliver would follow in the educational footsteps of her parents and work as a teacher. She first taught at University of the Streets, a school started by activists to work with the increasing number of youth of color who the city’s schools pushed out and permanently expelled.[^2] Later, Oliver taught at East Harlem Prep, a school run by an anti-poverty advocacy organization.
Her later teaching, however, was not just the product of growing up in a family of educators. Oliver’s work as an educator and within the Young Lords Party grew from her experiences as a Black student attending a predominantly white school only recently desegregated, as well as her commitment to social justice. In 1957, at a time when other middle-class Black families were starting to move to the suburbs, Oliver’s parents were able to purchase a home in the largely white neighborhood of Hollis in Queens. During her first day of school at JHS 59, Oliver remembered, “getting off the bus, commotion going on, and a white kid with blood streaming down his face. There were fights going on in the yard. There were white students who had jumped on some black students, there were black students fighting back, there were [white] parents protesting the busing of kids into the neighborhood . . . You could feel the hostility immediately.”[^3] Denise Oliver, like other future members of the Young Lords, were profoundly shaped by white resistance to desegregation in New York. In the words of historian Johanna Fernández, “the young people who launched the Young Lords in New York would be influenced by their own experiences with racism in the classroom and by the politics bequeathed to them by the struggle for school reform in New York.”[^4]
As a college student at Howard University, a historically Black university, Oliver was an avid activist. The university eventually expelled her for participating in protests that highlighted the absence of a Black studies program, criticized the presence of the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) on campus, and challenged the strict rules prohibiting male students from visiting female students, and vice-versa, in the university’s single-sex dorms. [^5]
Oliver brought a powerful political vision and these experiences to her work in the founding and leading of the Young Lords. As a political organization, the Young Lords sought to understand the structural roots of poverty, segregation, and inequality. Then based on these analyses, worked with local community members to organize protests and demonstrations as well as create new institutions that reflected the values of the egalitarian society they hoped to build.
