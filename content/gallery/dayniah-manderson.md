Manderson is a teacher at Mott Hall Community School in Throggs Neck in the Bronx. For twelve years, she couldn't use the restroom at her workplace because it was inaccessible to a wheelchair user. In March, 2021, after years of asking, she filed a lawsuit to force her school to provide this basic accommodation. As of 2022, nearly 80% of public schools in New York City are partially inaccessible, meaning some classrooms, hallways, or bathrooms can not be accessed by people with mobility disabilities.
