Milton Galamison was the pastor of Siloam Presbyterian Church in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn and a key figure in the struggle to desegregate New York City’s schools. As a religious and civic leader, he was the chair of Education Committee for the Brooklyn branch of NAACP, founded the Parents’ Workshop for Equality in New York Schools, and organized the Citywide Committee for Integrated Schools. The Citywide Committee was a collaboration between the Parents’ Workshop, the NAACP, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), National Urban League, and Harlem Parents’ Committee to organize the 1964 boycott.

In this interview, Galamison speaks about his work in New York and specifically why he pursued the desegregation of New York’s schools.
