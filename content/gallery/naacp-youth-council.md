The history presented of the Civil Rights Movement often focuses on adults, ignoring the crucial role played by young people. When their stories are present, it’s usually the stories of college students. However, middle and high school students have long taken part in demonstrations, and even organized their own. To understand how a school boycott of nearly 500,000 adults and children happened, it is necessary to recognize the longer history of student activism that came before the 1964 boycott. 
The document above comes from a publication printed by NAACP’s Youth Council called The Challenge. Starting in 1935, the NAACP organized youth councils, originally composed of young people ages nineteen to twenty-five. Over time, more high school students joined and so junior youth councils were created for students thirteen and under. Youth councils throughout the country took part in demonstrations and even started their own. Adult leaders, like Ella Baker, supported young people as they determined which issues were important to them and helped bring their ideas to the broader public. This issue of The Challenge, their publication, illustrated how students crafted their own voice to challenge segregation.
