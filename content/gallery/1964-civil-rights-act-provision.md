Signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on June 2, 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race, religion, sex, and national origin. The Act banned segregation in public places, including schools, parks, theaters, and hotels, and it denied the use of federal funds for any program that practiced segregation. The Act even authorized the Office of Education to assist in facilitating school desegregation.
The first version of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was introduced by President John F. Kennedy in June 1963. After President Kennedy’s assisination, President Johnson took up the cause to push through the legislation. Although President Johnson played a key role in pushing the bill through congress amidst Southern opposition, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. made clear in January 1964, “the civil rights legislation now before Congress . . . was born in the streets of Birmingham amid snarling dogs and the battering of fire hoses. It was fashioned in the jail cells of the South and by the marching feet in the North.” Its passage was the result of decades of organizing and activism that sought justice and equality.
However, the full demands of the activists did not make it all the way through the legislative process, and President Johnson signed a watered-down version of the original bill. While many historians emphasize southern politicians’ opposition to the Civil Rights Act, Northerners also played a critical role in scaling back its provisions, especially those related to the desegregation of public schools.
Emanuel Celler, a U.S. Congressman from Brooklyn, NY played a critical role in drafting the legislation and pushing it through the House of Representatives. In his overseeing of the bill’s passage through the house, he helped craft and enable two amendments that would preserve segregated schools in the North. First, he, along with Illinois senator Everett Dirksen and Montana senator Mike Mansfield, added an “antibusing” amendment that prevent “any official or court of the United States to issue any order seeking to achieve a racial balance in any school by requiring the transportation of pupils or students from one school to another or one school district to another in order to achieve such racial balance, or otherwise enlarge the existing power of the court to insure compliance with constitutional standards.” Southern congressmen intent on preserving segregation in the South recognized the hypocrisy of Northern congressmen who sought to desegregate schools in the South while preventing desegregation in the North. Second, Congressman Celler oversaw the change in the legislation that limited the definition of desegregation, and thus government action to enforce the eradication of school segregation, especially in the North.
These changes in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, largely through the work of Northern politicians, represented two important dimensions of Jim Crow in the North. For one, it represented how Northern politicians differentiated segregation in the North versus that in the South. This rendering which positioned “de facto” (by circumstance) against “de jure” (by law) segregation, obscured the role government policy at the federal, state, and local level that led to segregated schools. By claiming schools in the North were “de facto” segregated, housing policies that created segregated white and Black neighborhoods disappeared; the decisions to construct schools within neighborhoods to maintain school segregation remained unchallenged; and school boards’ drawing of school zoning lines were rendered invisible. Moreover, the color-blind approach of the legislation (“assignment of students to public schools . . . without regard to their race, color, religion, or national origin) restricted possibilities for desegregation, for, if there was not a law that stated explicitly attempts to segregate schools and if plaintiffs could not prove explicit racial identification, school segregation could persist, and it did.
To be sure, northern politicians claimed a racial innocence, denying that these changes were hypocritical. Yet, for many southern politicians, it was clear. Indeed, shortly after the Senate opened debate on the Civil Rights Act, 15,000 white mothers in New York City, like other white parents throughout the country, took to the streets to protest attempts at desegregation. Thus, the political activism of white parents in the North and northern politicians in congress maintained segregation in northern schools, including in New York City.
