Evelina López was born in Salinas, Puerto Rico in 1922. She was the eldest of three daughters. In 1933, when Evelina was eleven years old, her mother sent her to live with her aunt and uncle in New York City. Her mother, along with her two sisters, joined her two years later. Antonetty’s early school experiences in New York City were alienating and left scars that lasted for decades. In a later interview she recalled that “The Hispanics from Central America, the Haitains, the blacks from the south and the Puerto Ricans all have problems with language and customs. They experience rejection like I did. They feel like outsiders!”[^1] Eventually, Evelina López found a way to succeed as a student at Wadleigh High School in Harlem, but the initial rejection would later form an important foundation in her organizing for quality education. 
Evelina lived in “El Barrio” - East Harlem - during this period, and the vibrancy of the community provided a political education that also proved important in her later organizing work. Coming of age during the Great Depression, she saw many in her community unable to find work, but too ashamed to need “home relief.” She decided to help her neighbors by gathering their vouchers, collecting their food, and delivering it to them. Additionally, she protested alongside neighbors who were evicted from their homes. She helped them move furniture back into their homes after it had been tossed onto the sidewalk outside their apartments. As a high school student, she and three classmates staged a boycott after a student had become ill at school, where there was no nurse on site. Antonetty and her peers took action to draw attention to the lack of adequate medical care. All the while, she was developing her political stance while learning from revolutionary figures, like Jesús Colón, who lived in the neighborhood. He helped her explore how the struggles and activism of people of color connected across national boundaries. From very early on, it was clear that Evelina understood the structural nature of educational inequality and grew up in an environment that expanded visions of what educational justice could look like for Black and Puerto Rican students.
From the 1940s into the 1960s, Evelina Antonetty expanded her political vision as both a union worker and a parent. She eloped in 1941 with her first husband, but, after she felt she had outgrown their union, they divorced. She married Donato Antonetty in 1955. Her first two children entered P.S. 5 in the South Bronx while she was home taking care of her youngest child, Donald. She increasingly became involved in her daughters’ school. Like many Puerto Rican parents in the South Bronx, Antonetty was frustrated and confused about why so many Spanish-speaking children were not learning to read. Many were were being placed in classes intended for students with severe disabilities because they spoke Spanish. “I began to see the schools as an island,” Antonetty recalled, “After 3 o’clock, the school officials closed the doors and left the community. They made no input into the community. There were no teachers in the school from the community.”
