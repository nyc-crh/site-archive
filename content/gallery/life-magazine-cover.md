The organizing of the 1963 March for Jobs and Freedom was an amazing success. More than 200,000 people participated. Over the next few years, the federal government in response to the march and civil rights activism throughout the country passed the Civil Rights Act (1964), the Voting Rights Act (1965), and the Fair Housing Act (1968). Not all of the demands of the march were met and even the legislation passed did not always meet the imaginations of activists and organizers. However, the organizing tradition that A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin, among others, had cultivated through labor movements reached a new prominence in the 1950s and 1960s which opened the door for greater possibilities. 
Indeed, as the NAACP and other organizations began to organize a boycott of New York Cityâ€™s schools in 1964, they enlisted Bayard Rustin as the lead organizer for what proved to be an even larger demonstration than the March on Washington.
