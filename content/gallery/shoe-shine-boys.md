In late 1963, The New York Amsterdam News reported on allegations that teachers and administrators at P.S. 614 in Brooklyn, one to the cityâ€™s "600" schools. The teachers being investigated allegedly pocketed over 40,000 subway tokens meant for students. Instead of handing the tokens out, students were forced to perform menial tasks like washing cars or shining shoes to earn the tokens back. Not only were students being mistreated, they were supposed to be learning during school hours. The school's principal and administrators didn't offer any information at the time but were later reassigned to a different school.
