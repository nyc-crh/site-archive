The 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom organized by A. Philip Randolph sought to enact changes in myriad ways. The first would be a planned demonstration involving more than 200,000 people. Randolph was also able to secure a meeting between John F. Kennedy and a selected delegation of Civil Rights leaders. Included in the meeting were Dr. King, John Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph. They hoped to discuss policy proposals and changes that were the purpose of the demonstration. Following Randolph’s lead, they wanted to show how economic security (jobs) and freedom were closely tied. The organizers also wanted to call for the end to racial discriminiation in both the South and the North. Among specific issues they wanted addressed included the end of racialized police brutality, assurance of voting rights, desegregated schools, and a federal works program guaranteeing employment. The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom is often represented by the “I Have a Dream” speech, but there is more than just the singular speech to explore about this March. The policy demands the March asked for were considered by many to be radical and far-sweeping.
It was these demands that the delegation of the demonstration would discuss with President Kennedy. Notably absent from this meeting was Baynard Rustin, who was urged by his colleagues not to attend. They felt his gayness and his past affiliation with the Communist Party would embarrass them and make it harder to have their demands met.
