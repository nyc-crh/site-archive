caption: In re Matter of Skipwith is a 1958 court case where the parents of twelve-year-olds in Harlem, participants in the “Harlem Nine” boycott, were charged with neglect. The parents claimed the Board of Education created and maintained segregated and inferior schools for Black students. Therefore, they were not required to send their children to them. The judge ruled in favor of the parents.

On October 28, 1958, in two separate cases, the Board of Education charged the Harlem Nine for violating the state’s truancy law. Judge Nathaniel Kaplan, the presiding judge in the first case, found four of the parents guilty of violating the law.[^1] Less than two weeks later, Judge Justine Polier, who presided over the second case, dismissed the charges against the parents in her courtroom.
During the trial, the parents explained that they had kept their children out of school because of the unequal conditions. The parents presented data that documented the overcrowding in their children’s assigned schools and lack of regularly licensed teachers. Although JHS 136 had 1,560 students in the school, there were 85 teachers, only 42 of whom were regularly licensed. Of the eleven math teachers in the school, only two were licensed, and only three of the six science teachers on staff were licensed. As a result, the school regularly operated with substitute teachers ill-equipped to provide long-term educational programs necessary for student learning.[^2] This was, as the attorneys for the parents showed, a common pattern in schools serving a majority of Black and Puerto Rican students in New York City, but much less common for schools serving white students.
In her opinion, Judge Polier agreed with the boycotting parents that their children were receiving “inferior educational opportunities in those schools by reason of racial discrimination,” and, therefore, were not in violation of the state’s compulsory education law. Judge Polier repeated the Board’s assertion that the segregation was “de facto” in nature, the result of housing patterns and not the result of any wrongdoing on behalf of the Board. Nonetheless, she ruled that the Board had the legal responsibility to operate integrated schools and that they had the power to distribute qualified teachers fairly across the city’s schools .
The excerpted opinion here illuminates how Judge Polier interpreted this evidence as well as the responsibility of school districts in addressing segregation.

After Judge Polier’s ruling, the Board of Education agreed to transfer the children of the Harlem Nine to different schools that their parents thought offered better opportunities. However, segregation continued for most children in Harlem schools.
