Like many Puerto Rican parents in the South Bronx, Evelina Antonetty was frustrated and confused about why so many Spanish-speaking children were not learning to read. Many were were being placed in classes intended for students with severe disabilities because they spoke Spanish. “I began to see the schools as an island,” Antonetty recalled, “After 3 o’clock, the school officials closed the doors and left the community. They made no input into the community. There were no teachers in the school from the community.”[^1]
Antonetty’s organizing work led to the founding of United Bronx Parents, Inc. in 1965. The organization’s early focus was on bilingual education because so many of the neighborhood youth came from Spanish-speaking families, and the Board of Education failed to provide the education they deserved and needed. However, as the flyer above demonstrates, Antonetty did not work independently, but, as historian Adina Back put it, “The UBP’s central political intention was to enable an articulate and informed group of parents to demand improvements in their children’s schools.”[^2] The commitment to present school demands based on the wishes of parents can be seen in the flyer’s call to parents: “VENGA A DARNOS SUS VALIOSAS IDEAS” (“Come - Give Us Your Valuable Ideas”).
