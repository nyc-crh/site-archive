Asa Phillip Randolph was born in Crescent City, Florida in 1889. Early in his life his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida. There he was raised in a vibrant Black community.[^1] He felt forced to move away, however, because of the systemic violence of the Jim Crow laws in the South. The South also provided little economic opportunity for Black men. Randolph felt compelled to migrate to New York City in 1911. While living there he did various jobs while taking classes at City College.
In 1917, Randolph began to take leadership roles in the labor movement. His most famous role began in 1925 as the president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP). Sleeping Car Porters worked on trains back when train travel was the most popular way to travel the country. Only more affluent people could afford to book sleeping cars, and they expected to be treated well as they traveled. The porters were responsible for carrying passengers’ baggage, shining shoes, preparing passengers’ sleeping arrangements, and making the ride pleasant.
Porters worked long and grueling hours. A porter would have to work nearly 400 hours a month to earn a living wage. They were often required to work unpaid hours preparing and cleaning up after meals.[^2] These inhumane working conditions were because of the Pullman Company’s racist business practices. The Pullman Company was one of the largest employers of Black workers in the country. It used that as leverage to force the Black porters to work under terrible conditions. Randolph organized porters to challenge Pullman’s racist practices. Together the porters were able to improve wages and working conditions. Randolph’s organizing tactics would be foundational to the new direction of the Black Freedom Struggle in the twentieth century.His analysis of racism’s economic dimensions would also continue to provide a blueprint for understanding social conditions.[^3]
The two rally posters above show some of Randolph’s early organizing techniques. For example, the posters call for both porters, who were men, and maids, who were women. Randolph felt everyone needed to be included in labor organizing. Most labor movements at the time included only white men, not Black people or women. Randolph also held his rallies in the community, at places like schools, where he knew everyone could attend.
