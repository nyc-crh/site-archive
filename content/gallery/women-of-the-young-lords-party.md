As Oliver describes in this video, women involved in the Civil Rights Movement had to navigate sexism within the movement in order to build the liberated society imagined by the Young Lords and other revolutionary groups. Oliver did just that. In addition to her community organizing, she also challenged the misogyny within the ranks of the Young Lords Party. In collaboration with Iris Morales and other women in the party, Oliver challenged the centering of men and masculinity in the party’s struggles to push for more robust ideas of liberation. As a result of this work, the Young Lords withdrew its idea of “Revolutionary Machismo” as necessary for liberation; elected women to the Central Committee and pushed for representation of women in all levels of leadership; instituted punishments for sexist behavior within the party; formed a gay caucus as well as men and women’s caucuses for addressing sexism; and committed to ensuring equal participation between men and women as writers and public speakers.
