Although City College, where Audre Lorde taught, was in the predominantly Black and Latinx community of Harlem, there were very few Black or Latinx students who attended. In the 1968-1969 school year, City College students organized to demand change in admissions policies, curriculum, and support. They identified “Five Demands”:

1. “A school of Black and Puerto Rican Studies”

2. “A freshman orientation for Black and Puerto Rican Students”

3. Student control over the SEEK program

4. Student populations in incoming classes that reflected the racial composition of the New York City high schools, not City College’s historically white student population

5. “That all education majors be required to take Black and Puerto Rican history and the Spanish language.”

Some faculty members, including Audre Lorde, showed their solidarity with the student protesters. To respect student’s shut-down of the main campus, Lorde moved her classes off campus to a local middle school, which the students had renamed “The University of Harlem.”

The student strike was successful in bringing about major changes at City College and in the City University System. Student demands help bring about the creation of Black Studies and Puerto Rican Studies programs at Brooklyn College, where Audre Lorde later taught. Student activism also supported the continuation of the SEEK (Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge) program and led to a new open admissions policy at CUNY, where any student who completed high school in New York City would be admitted to at least one of the CUNY community colleges or four-year colleges.
However, CUNY campuses remained inaccessible for many disabled students. In the early 1970s, disabled students at Brooklyn College formed the activist organization SOFEDUP and waged their own protests for an accessible education.
