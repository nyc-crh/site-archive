In 1965, nearly a year after the massive 1964 boycott, Reverend Milton Galamison and the Citywide Committee on Integration launched another boycott. Galamison and the Citywide Committee - which included — CORE (Congress On Racial Equality), Parents Workshop on Equality in NY Schools, Harlem Parents Committee, EQUAL, and the Negro Teachers Association) focused on the "600" schools, which had "inadequate facilities, no curriculum, untrained teachers, and improperly screened students." The groups’ demands included promoting many more Black and Puerto Rican teacher to leadership positions like school principals, desegregating junior high schools, and improving the “600” schools.  Reverend Galamison was arrested for violating state education laws by "encouraging truancy," when young people stayed out of school to boycott.
