eventname: 600 schools effectiveness called into question
caption: "This article frames a debate about \"600\" schools, about a decade after the first \"600\" school opened. Proponents for expanding the schools pointed to a \"growing problem\" of \"incorrgibles\" who behaved \"disruptively\" in their classes. People against expansion of separate schools pointed to a flawed system for selecting students, students in \"600\" schools who needed other kinds of support, and the stigma students felt when sent to these segregated schools."

New York City’s “600” schools were established in the 1940s to educate “socially maladjusted” and “delinquent” youth. Their original purpose was to reform young people who had “lost their way.” By the 1960s the schools began labeling students as “socially maladjusted” and or “emotionally disturbed”—what we would call emotional or mental health disabilities today. Some of the "600" schools were housed in institutions like jails, and hospitals, but most were called "day schools" and were created only for students with mental health and/or emotional disabilities that impacted their ability to learn. 
Despite their stated purpose, the "600" schools looked like another way to segregate students by race. The vast majority of "600" school students were Black and Puerto Rican and most came from poor neighborhoods. Students were referred to the schools by school personnel, which was sometimes influenced by racism. Some had difficult family lives and others had learning or intellectual disabilities that were not identified, so they didn't get the kind of educational support they needed. By the 1960s, the NYC Board of Education started building new "600" schools to keep up with "demand" for space to educate these students. But the quality of general education was often very poor. Students fell behind academically and were not expected to succeed. 
This article from 1958 describes some of these problems education experts pointed out. Some worried the schools were "custodial rather than therapeutic." Advocates, including some school principals, argued for funding for mental health services in regular schools and opposed separate schools because of the stigma students would feel.
