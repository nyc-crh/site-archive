In 1969, parents in the South Bronx sought to improve the meals provided to their students by the New York City Board of Education. A group of parents, mostly mothers, came to Evelina López Antonetty, executive director of the United Bronx Parents (UBP), for help in addressing the issue. UBP agreed to help and, in the months that followed, documented how inadequate school lunches were and planned better options.
In New York, the Bureau of School Lunches, a department within the Board of Education, oversaw the school lunch program. To provide meals throughout the city, the Bureau of School Lunches used  a soup kitchen in Long Island City, Queens that had been  built decades earlier in the Great Depression. There workers prepared sandwiches and soups for students. The sandwiches put together in the morning typically were dried out by the time they arrived at schools and the soups arrived watery and unappetizing. The prepackaged milk made things worse. It was often served sour because it went unrefrigerated on delivery. The Bureau of School Lunches focused on providing cheap meals, and they failed to  adequately feed students.
For the low-income Black and Latinx students and families attending PS 25 and other schools in the South Bronx, the school lunches were a critical source of food. Yet, the poor quality of the meals made their stomachs turn at the prospect of eating it, and, as a result, many students threw their lunches away. Black and Latinx parents sometimes felt uncertain about challenging school officials, most of whom were white, but the issue of school lunches was an issue parents felt confident about. According to one mother, “The principal may know more about reading and teaching, but when it comes to food I’m just as much of an expert as he is.” For parents who didn’t speak English, confronting the school about poor educational services could be difficult. However, regardless of the language they spoke, they were experts in feeding their children and felt empowered to demand changes in the school.
The parents knew that challenging their children’s schools and the Board of Education’s bureaucracy would be a challenge. They turned to Evelina Antonetty and United Bronx Parents for help. However, Antonetty did not immediately determine the path forward for the parents. In line with her vision of political organizing, she empowered the parents to determine what actions to take. They determined to conduct an investigation of schools in their area to document how school lunches were prepared and served, the quality of the food, the (un)cleanliness of cafeterias, and the experiences of students eating school lunch. At a number of schools, the parent activists found that despite not having dishwashers on site, many of the cafeterias used regular silverware rather than disposable plastic. In another school, the parents found lunch deliveries were always late, there was no freezer, the stove didn’t work, and there weren’t enough tables to seat all the students eating lunch. Students complained about the quality of food, how little time they had to eat, and the limited options they had for meals.
On April 10, 1969, Antonetty and the parents staged a surprise political demonstration. They had invited lawmakers to the UBP office, but, once everyone arrived, Antonetty shepherded them all onto a school bus and drove them to PS 25, where the parent demonstrators were waiting for them. Instead of eating a meal at UBP, the parent activists and Antonetty planned for these public officials to eat the same meals students were forced to eat and sit in the cafeteria where students had to dine. Before they sat for their meal, the press and public officials were led to the school’s auditorium where parent speakers explained the inadequacy of current school lunches and presented their demand for changes.
When the invited guests moved into the cafeteria, things went as expected. They were repulsed by the food and pandemonium occured when someone spotted mouse droppings in the cafeteria. In fact, one of the city’s assemblymen in attendance got sick after eating the food. In an hour, the parent activists had made their point. 
The demonstration led to action. With blinding speed, the officials present demanded a Health Department investigation of schools in the district. James Scheuer, a Congressmen from the Bronx, called for an immediate federal investigation, and he continued to make school lunch a priority in the federal government. In 1981, he introduced an amendment to the Federal School Lunch Act to require participating schools to improve the quality of school lunches and establish their own nutrition councils to oversee these improvements. 
While the call for investigations and the press’ coverage of the event brought public attention to the issue, it was only the first step towards changing the situation. After their day at PS 25, UBP extended an offer to those present for a real lunch. Now that they had seen what school lunches are really like, UBP said they would “be delighted to serve [them] ‘a real school lunch’ the way it should be.” On May 2, UBP hosted the same group of officials at JHS 98 for school lunch as “it should be.” Workers prepared the food on site, the ingredients were fresh, and lunch resembled the kind of food students would eat at home. Prepared by a Black man who had been a cook in the army and a woman who had been a cook in Puerto Rico, the meal consisted of sliced pineapples, sweet potatoes, stewed beans, spare ribs, sweet plantains with butter, scrambled eggs, fried chicken, and roasted pork chops. The meal fed 500 people, and it demonstrated that the Bureau of School Lunches could use the same budget they had for stale food to prepare students healthy and hearty meals.
The food activism of UBP and parents in the community continued to properly feed young people throughout the city. In early 1970, UBP conducted another large demonstration by filling up two large pickup trucks with bags of school lunches that students had refused to eat and delivered them to the United States Department of Agriculture headquarters. During the summers of 1971 and 1972, UBP led a free summer lunch program. Since many students depended on school provided lunches, summers were difficult because it meant those meals weren’t accessible anymore. When UBP started its free summer lunch program, it was the sole provider of free summer lunches in the city. When the program first began, UBP prepared and distributed 50,000 lunches a day, but, within two summers, UBP fed an average of 250,000 children a day.
