In the 1954 case Brown v. Board of Education the Supreme Court found segregated schools to be unconstitutional. Activists like Ella Baker, Mae Mallory, and Kenneth Clark had worked tirelessly to desegregate the city’s schools. The battle, however, was not yet over. City and school officials used a variety of tactics to continue to practice segregation. This report was published by the Urban League of Greater New York, a civil rights organization founded in 1910 and whose work included the March on Washington. It traces how Black residents challenged segregation and how city politicians thwarted those challenges.
