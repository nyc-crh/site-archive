The second school boycott took place on March 16, 1964. Fewer people participated in the second boycott, but feelings about the city’s segregated and unequal school system remained strong. Black New Yorkers held different opinions on source of oppression and how to respond to it. The organizers of the boycotts believed that school integration was the next move. Others, like Malcolm X, supported the idea of Black Nationalism. They promoted economic self-sufficiency and pride in Black identity. They also believed in the formation of an independent Black nation. In spite of these differing views, Malcolm X took part in the second boycott. He describes why he participated in this interview.
