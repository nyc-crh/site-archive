questions:
  - Does the political education class in the picture look like classrooms in your school? What’s similar? What’s different?
  - What made the Young Lords’ political education classes different than traditional schoolrooms? Why might that have been effective?
  - As noted above, many of the Young Lords Party members were illiterate, what resources did the party provide to its members so they could meaningfully participate in these political education classes? How might the centering of learner needs like this impacted the party?
  - If you were working with your peers to create a learning space for one another, what would it look like?
