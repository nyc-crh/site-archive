On March 12, 1964 - more than a month after the first boycott and four days before the second - a group of white parents called “Parents and Taxpayers” led a march from the Board of Education building in Brooklyn to City Hall in Manhattan. The reactionary group was stitched into a broader history of white resistance to desegregation. Indeed, local politicians acting on behalf of their white constituents had long ensured segregation of New York City’s schools (See document set How Do You Segregate a School System?). The group “Parents and Taxpayers,” however did represent a new type of mobilization that used the same protest tactics developed over the course of the twentieth century Black Freedom Struggle (e.g. marches and boycotts) to campaign for the continued segregation. Moreover, they painted themselves as entitled to segregated schools given what they believed was their high citizenship status. As historian Matthew Delmont has observed, “these white protestors made an implicit claim that they occupied a higher level of citizenship than lack and Puerto Rican New Yorkers who were also parents and taxpayers” because they implied the Brown decision violated their rights as taxpayers. Parents and Taxpayers maintained that segregation was not based upon race and their resistance to desegregation was not racist; they were, in their words, protesting the government’s violation of their civil rights as protestors. 
White New Yorkers, like those in other cities throughout the North, used phrases like “neighborhood schools” and “busing” as a way to frame their segregationist resistance as something else. They claimed they were fighting for “neighborhood schools” and tradition and that their opposition to “busing” was about their children’s safety, not maintaining segregated schools. However, by the 1950s, most children in the United States rode buses to school and the concept of a neighborhood school was more of an idea than a reality in many cities, including New York.
