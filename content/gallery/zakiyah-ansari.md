Zakiyah Ansari has been a parent leader advocating better education for her children and their peers for more than twenty years. She is the Advocacy Director for the Alliance for Quality Education, which has been working on an equity lawsuit in New York called the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. In 1993, black and brown parents in Washington Heights initiated a lawsuit, which took 13 years to work its way through the courts. In 2006, the Court of Appeals ruled that New York State was not meeting its constitutional obligation to provide every child with a sound basic education.
