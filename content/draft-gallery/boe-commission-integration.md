questions:
  - According to the subcommittee report, why were New York City Schools segregated? Why was the segregation of New York City Schools a problem?
  - What narratives within the report help to hide the actions that created and sustained segregation within and between New York Public Schools?
  - In 2014, researchers identified New York City schools as some of the most segregated in the U.S. Soon after, Mayor Bill de Blasio created a “School Diversity Advisory Group” for the New York City Department of Education to discuss ways to address this issue. How do you think Ella Baker would feel knowing about the continued segregation of New York schools? What advice do you think she would offer the School Diversity Advisory Group?

In the 1954 decision in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, the Supreme Court of the United States of America ruled that school segregation was unconstitutional. Their reasoning was separate schools for Black children were “inherently unequal.” Citing the work of  Kenneth Clark, the court argued that segregated schools taught a message of racial superiority. The law made it seem that white people were superior to black people.[^1]
Before and after the decision, activists in New York City remained engaged in efforts to desegregate the city’s schools. Ella Baker was the first woman president of the New York City chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She used a multi-pronged approach to advocate for school desegregation. The prongs included institutional lobbying and direct action. She joined and co-led (along with Kenneth Clark) the Intergroup Committee on Public Schools. The committee was a group, founded by the Urban League of Greater New York, to bring together people who wanted to improve public education in the city. Under Ella Baker’s leadership, the committee published a report entitled, “Children Apart.” The report documented the increase of school segregation. It also documented the devastating effects of racially segregated public schools in New York City. Ell was also commited to empower parents and community members to have direct input on schools. Ella Baker wanted to help community members get involved in schools. She organized Parents in Action Against Educational Discrimination, a group of mostly Black and Puerto Rican parents. Parents in Action led protests and rallies to put pressure on elected officials to desegregate New York’s Schools.[^2]
In response to this pressure, New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner asked the New York City Board of Education to make a Commission on Integration in 1956. The New York State Legislature outlawed segregating schools by race in 1900.[^3] Yet officials were still able to create rules that led to segregated schools. This included drawing school zone boundaries that were the same as the housing zone boundaries.[^4] School districts argued that the segregation in their schools was “de facto segregation,” or segregation by circumstance.[^5] They claimed the school segregation was an accident and therefore they were not responsible. But, these claims ignored how government policy helped create segregated housing  patterns. They also ignored how school boards created segregated school zones.
Ella Baker was a member of the Commission on Integration’s zoning subcommittee.
She wanted the Board to push for integration and allow all students to go to school together. But the subcommittee ended up pushing for desegregation. They just didn’t want there to be rules about where a student could go to school, but they didn’t care if students could actually attend anywhere. The Board said they believed in integration, but they did nothing to show it. Ella Baker continued to push for policy changes by joining committees and organizing with young people. She then went on to join the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Eventually she went on to help found the Student Nonviolent Campaign Committee.[^6]
