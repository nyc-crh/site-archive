questions:
  - The Amsterdam News used the term "Harlem Nine" to remind readers of the  "Little Rock Nine" who desegregated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas one year earlier. What do the parallels between the "Harlem Nine" and the "Little Rock Nine" show us about the history of segregation in the United States? How does the story of the "Harlem Nine” challenge our traditional understandings of segregation?
  - How did the "Harlem Nine” expose segregation and inequality in New York City’s schools? What risks did they take? How do you think their children felt about their parents’ protests? 
  - What does the "Harlem Nine” case, and especially the use of the courts to punish parents opposing segregated schools, show us  about the connection between schools and law enforcement?

In 1958, one year after nine black students desegregated Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, nine mothers in Harlem decided to keep their children out of local junior high schools to protest both segregation and the poor conditions in those schools.[^1] Dubbed the “Harlem Nine” by the press, these mothers kept their children home from segregated Black schools, which had more limited curriculum and higher proportions of unlicensed teachers than the city’s segregated white schools. The Board of Education eventually sued the children’s mothers for violating the state’s compulsory education law, which required parents to enroll their students in school and ensure their attendance. However, the parents viewed the segregated zoning policies of the Board as a direct violation of their children’s civil rights. By boycotting the schools, they called attention to how the Board denied those rights. Their protest also showed how far these women were willing to go to improve their children’s educational chances.[^2] As one of the parents told reporters, “We will go to jail and rot there if necessary, but our children will not go to Jr. High Schools, 136, 139, or 120.”[^3]
The boycott was not the first action taken by these activists. In 1957, Mae Mallory appeared at a public hearing of the Board of Education’s Commission on Integration to accuse the New York City’s schools of operating under a “Jim Crow” policy, a term commonly used to describe racial segregation in the South. Mallory, a later member of the Harlem Nine, made this statement alongside other notable Harlem activists like Ella Baker. Unfortunately, many white members of the Commission on Integration, including the superintendent, refused to acknowledge race and racism within the city’s school system.[^4]
At the start of the boycott, the parents partnered with the Reverend Eugene Callender, minister at the Mid-Harlem Community Parish, to ensure their children would still receive an education. Reverend Callender offered his church as a site for the students’ classes. Over the ensuing month, the children were taught English, math, social studies, world events, music, French, and art appreciation by five licensed teachers and Paul and Barbara Zuber. However, the boycotting parents soon realized that the Board would not prosecute the parents for their children’s truancy - which would bring more attention to their cause -  since this replacement schooling was so effective. Therefore, to make their protest more clear and force the city to act, the parents ended the private tutoring, choosing no schooling for their children over segregated and unequal schooling.  They also filed a claim against the city for $1 million in which the they accused the city of “sinister and discriminatory purpose in the perpetuation of racial segregation in five school districts in Harlem.”[^5] In a bold move, the suit named the city’s School Superintendent, Mayor, the Board of Education, and the Board of Estimates as defendants. 
At that same time, the Board had sued the mothers on charges of violating the state’s truancy law. Two separate cases were brought against the women, and, in the first, the judge ruled in favor of the Board. However, in a separate trial, some of the mothers encountered a judge who understood the issue differently. See the document “In Re Skipwith” to find out how.
