caption: The map above illustrates the New York Board of Education’s 1930s-1940s zoning of Wadleigh High School. The school zone line is imposed on a map of U.S. Census data on race from 1940. In 1940, the only the racial categories on the U.S. Census were “White,” “Black,” and “Other,” and, therefore, do not fully capture the diversity of the area.

This map shows how the New York City Board of Education zoned Wadleigh High School, an all-girls school, during the 1930s and 1940s. It shows the school zone lines and population data from the 1940 U.S. Census to illustrate who was living in the  area at this time. In 1940, the U.S. Census provided three racial categories to choose from: “White,” “Black,” and “Other.” So, while this map shows clear segregation between “White” and “Black” neighborhoods in the area, it does not fully show the diversity of the area. Anyone who didn’t fall into those two categories isn’t shown on this map.
In the 1930s, Harlem parents challenged the segregation of schools in the neighborhood. One issue they fought about was the Board of Education’s drawing of school zones to show where students could or could not attend school. While the Board before allowed students to attend high schools throughout the city, the new zone lines made children go to only schools in that zone. Julia Richman, another all-girls high school, used to receive a lot of students from Central Harlem. However, after the drawing of these zones, the Board decided that “students from certain schools in the neighborhood of Wadleigh should be denied admission to Julia Richman and should be advised to go to Wadleigh.”[^1]
Harlem parents pointed out that the Board of Education's school zones made Wadleigh an all-Black school. The city’s school superintendent said that wasn’t true. To substantiate his claim, he argued that since the Board permitted some Black students to cross zone lines there was no intent to segregate. But school authorities knew their lines would keep black students out of certain schools.
As a result of how the Board zoned Wadleigh in 1933, enrollment at the school dramatically changed. In 1931, Wadliegh identified 25% of its students at the 114th Street campus as “colored.” By 1943, the school identified 70 percent of its student body as “Negroes,” and, by 1945, that number rose to 98 percent. These new lines restricted Black students to Wadleigh and Haaren High School. It also stopped them from attending newer high schools in the city like George Washington and Julia Richman.[^2]
In the following decades, Harlem activists, like Ella Baker, worked with lawyers and activists to change the laws. Baker was a member of the Board of Education’s Intergroup Committee and organized Parents in Action against Educational Discrimination. Parents in Action was an organization for Black and Puerto Rican parents. Through her work in these roles, Baker fought school zoning that created and continued segregation.[^3]
