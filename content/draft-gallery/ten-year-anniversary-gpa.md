Willie Mae Goodman was a mother, wife, and cafeteria worker living in East Harlem. Her daughter Marguerite was born with substantial physical and intellectual disabilities. Mrs. Goodman and her husband cared for Marguerite for the first four years of her life - even though doctors had, from Marguerite’s infancy, urged her parents to place her in an institution. They predicted that Marguerite would not live beyond two years, and so she could be sent away.
By the time Marguerite was 4, Mr. and Mrs. Goodman decided to listen to the doctors who suggested that she could learn more if she were in an institution. They sent her to Willowbrook State School, on Staten Island. Mrs. Goodman had hoped that Marguerite would learn to walk, and then come home. That she would learn to talk, and be able to tell her her needs. She did not. Willowbrook, like many other  institutions for disabled people at the time, was a horrible place, more a warehouse rather than the school and warm home that Marguerite deserved.
Mrs. Goodman and her husband visited every time they could - Sundays and Wednesdays, only 3 hours - which, as Mrs. Goodman said, was not enough. And the facilities at Willowbrook worried Mrs. Goodman - they were overcrowded and unsafe, a space that President Kennedy, when he visited, described as “not fit for animals to live.”
After this criticism, officials who ran Willowbrook decided to move some patients out, to relieve the overcrowding. They moved Marguerite and about 200 other disabled people from Willowbrook to another former hospital on the Lower East Side, on Water Street. But they did not tell Mrs. Goodman, who arrived at Willowbrook to see her daughter, and was told that she was not there. As she recalled, it was  “heartbreaking for someone to send your child somewhere and not tell you where she it.”
Why did they move Marguerite? They chose those children who, again, they predicted “would live no longer than three years.” In a grim calculation, they thought they’d relieve crowding at Willowbrook by temporarily removing patients who would not be around long enough to return. Everywhere our kids [were sent, Mrs. Goodman said, the officials] “wanted to pick when they were going to die, not when they were going to live.”
Despite all of these predictions of her death, Marguerite, with the constant support of her mother, kept living. Mrs. Goodman organized to help make her life better. She pushed the hospital to let her see Marguerite in her living space, rather than only in the impersonal lobby. She noticed and contested the unsafe parts of the facility and urged repair. Marguerite kept living, and then the state cut the budget. Administrators planned to send her back to Willowbrook. Now they said that it was OK, because Marguerite and the other residents would only live another 6 months.
Mrs. Goodman kept organizing. The administrators said there was nothing she could do about it, nothing she could say about it. But Mrs. Goodman formed a parent’s association. They went to court - three times - to stop the transfer of her child back to Willowbrook. They forged alliances with the Black Panthers and the Young Lords, Black and Puerto Rican nationalist groups who had been advocating for health care and education in their communities - showed up at the hospital to keep residents from being put on buses for the transfer to Willowbrook.
And ultimately, they won. Marguerite was not sent back to Willowbrook. And within a few years, the city closed Willowbrook, and moved its former residents to smaller facilities closer to their parents and communities. Marguerite moved close to Mrs. Goodman in East Harlem - not far from here on 106th and Fifth Avenue. And she lived. She is now 65.
