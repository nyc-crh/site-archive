eventname: Elizabeth Cisco has a portrait made
caption: Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco lived in Jamaica, Queens, with her children and, until he passed away in 1897, her husband Samuel Cisco. She sat for this formal studio portrait at some point, although we do not know exactly what year. It could be before or after she and Samuel began to challenge school segregation in 1896, or before or after she sued the Queens school board in 1899.

questions:
  - What message do you think Mrs. Cisco wanted to send through this picture? What choices do you think she made that helped send that message?
  - Do you use photography to represent yourself? What kinds of decisions do you make about how you appear in photographs, and why?
  - How do you feel seeing a portrait of a Black woman who helped make segregation illegal in New York schools? 
  - Historian Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham writes about the "politics of respectability." She uses that term to argue that Black women of Cisco’s generation were contesting white supremacy while also insisting that Black people conformed "to the dominant society’s norms of manners and morals." Do you think that this portrait of Mrs. Cisco reflects "the politics of respectability"? Why might activist women like Mrs. Cisco might have chosen to present themselves as "respectable"?

Photography has an important place in African American history. Black people faced racism that denied their dignity and humanity. When racist practices and beliefs denied Black people’s dignity and humanity, Black individuals and families with the means to do so could go to a photography studio and present themselves as they wanted the world to see them. Frederick Douglass was a famous abolitionist and writer who had been born into slavery. He used photography to spread a powerful image of himself to the world. Douglas made himself the most photographed person in the US in the 19th century. This was when cameras were large, cumbersome, expensive, and had to be used in a photography studio.[^1]
Sojourner Truth also represented herself via photography. She printed “cartes de visite,” or printed and illustrated cards, with her image on them. She sold these to help fund her work - a point that she made in the caption of the cards themselves, which read “I Sell the Shadow to Support the Substance.” Truth made decisions, as well, about what clothing and what other objects would appear in her photographs.[^2]
The portrait above is of Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco, an African American woman who lived in Jamaica, Queens in the 1890’s, before Queens became part of New York City. Cisco and her husband used multiple strategies to try to secure a quality education for their children and to challenge school segregation.
Why did Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco choose to have this photograph made when she did? What were her ambitions in having the photograph made? Although we do not know the answers to these questions, we can ask how this photograph fits into larger traditions in Black photography. It stands as an example of how Black people could use photography as a demonstration of agency, self-representation and also protest.
