In 1970, about one quarter of all New York City public school students were Puerto Rican. And in some parts of the city, like the South Bronx, that proportion was much higher - 65 percent. Many Puerto Rican students spoke Spanish at home, but the local public schools operated almost exclusively in English.

United Bronx Parents organized parents in the South Bronx to fight for better schools for their children. UBP director Evelina Lopez Antonetty, who had come to New York from Puerto Rico as a child, presented this report to New York State education officials. In it she described her organization’s criticism of their schools - including the use of testing only in English to determine whether students had disabilities - and what steps the schools could take to make education more just for Puerto Rican students.
