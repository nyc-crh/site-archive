eventname: Mrs. Cisco lost in court but her fight led to New York adopting a new law to end legal segregation in schools.
caption: Although Mrs. Cisco did not win in the courtroom, the attention she brought to segregated schooling in New York led to the adoption of a new law that ended legal segregation in schools. This legislation was regularly referred to as “the Elsberg Bill” because state senator Nathaniel Elsberg introduced the bill. This Brooklyn Daily Eagle story narrates the events leading to the bill’s passage, the differing responses after its signing, and the opinion of Mrs. Cisco’s attorney George Wallace.

questions:
  - George Wallace, the attorney who represented the Cisco family throughout its legal battle for desegregation, is quoted at length in the end of the article. In your words, what is he saying here?
  - Although this law was passed over 100 years ago, New York City schools still remain some of the most segregated in the country. Why do you think that is? How might Wallace’s way of talking about the “Elsberg Bill” help explain why segregation continues?
  - Although much of the article narrates Mrs. Cisco’s legal battles, there is not a single quote from her in the story? Why might that be? Why do you think the paper did not include her voice in the article?

The passing of the “Elsberg Bill” came as a direct result of the continued activism of Mrs. Cisco and the broad network of Jamaica parents she collaborated with. They wanted to remove “all distinction of color in admission to public schools of the State of New York”. This story appeared in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. It narrates the events leading to the bill’s passage, talks about the differing responses to the passage and gives the opinion of Mrs. Cisco’s attorney George Wallace.
