questions:
  - Based on the report, how would you describe the conditions in Harlem schools in the 1930s? How are those conditions influenced by segregation? 
  - Mayor LaGuardia tried to shield the findings of his own commission from the general public. Why do you think he did that? What would have been the consequences if he was successful?
  - In 1935, the Commission concluded that persistent police brutality, racial discrimination in the labor market, segregated housing, and unequal education sparked what was called at the time a “riot.” How do the events of 1935 compare to the protests we see today, against police violence or other forms of injustice? Have the issues identified by the commission in 1935 been addressed today?

On March 19, 1935, rumors spread through Harlem that police had beaten a young man to death. The police arrested him for allegedly stealing a knife from a local store. The New York Police Department officers’ regularly used violence in policing the neighborhood. Therefore the rumor of murder sparked a revolt by community members concerned about policing and many other kinds of injustice in their community. The police responded to the uprising with violence, resulting in the death of three Black men. More than 100 arrests, and at least another 100 injured.[^1]

In the aftermath of the uprising, New York City Mayor Fiorella LaGuardia assembled a commission to investigate the causes of the events that night. The LaGuardia Commission included both Black and white researchers. Notable academics and community members like Countee Cullen, A. Phillip Randolph, and Franklin E. Frazier worked together to create the report. Eunice Hunton Carter was the only woman to serve on the committee. Nonetheless she played one of the most important roles in synthesizing the committee’s findings. A talented lawyer and social worker, Carter carried out much of the Commission’s work on the ground. She listened to community members’ complaints and concerns, which she incorporated into the final report.[^2]

In their research, the Commission reached several conclusions. First, that there was a  persistence of police brutality in the community. People faced racial discrimination in the labor market, and a segregated housing market. Finally, there were limited educational opportunities for Harlem’s Black students. Taken together, these factors were key reasons for the volatile response to the rumor of murder.
 
However, after the report’s completion, Mayor LaGuardia decided not to publish the report. He tried to keep its findings hidden, until the New York Amsterdam News printed it in its entirety. A the Amsterdam News made clear in their preface to  the report, it had previously remained unpublished because it "was considered too hot, too caustic, too critical, [and] too unfavorable by the Mayor."[^3]
 
The excerpts above come from the portion of the report that analyzes “the problem of education and recreation.” It specifically looks at the discriminatory practices that limited the educational opportunities of Black students in Harlem. These included the inequitable distribution of resources and the effects of academic tracking.
