New York City Black Deaf Advocates (NYCBDA) was founded in 1983, with a mission to better inform the Deaf Community about the rights and responsibilities of Black Deaf individuals. They also identify, examine and disseminate information related to the impact of social, economic, educational, political, religions and health issues through the medium of forums, panels, lectures and workshops as well as increased leadership development and job opportunities for Black Deaf persons and to further their potentials.
