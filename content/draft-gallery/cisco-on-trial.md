eventname: Samuel Cisco tries to enroll his children in the local segregated white public school.
caption: "The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported on a dramatic moment in what it later called the \"Jamaica school wars,\" when Samuel B. Cisco tried to enroll his children, who were Black, in the local segregated white public school. They were refused admission by white school administrators. Mr. Cisco then refused to send his children to the segregated \"colored\" school - and officials responded by charging him with violating New York’s law requiring school attendance for children."

Samuel B. Cisco, a Black man, lived in Jamaica, in Queens County. At the time of this newspaper article, in 1896, Queens was not yet part of New York City. Jamaica was a small town surrounded by a rural landscape. Mr. Cisco ran a successful scavenger business and with his wife Elizabeth he had six children.[^1] Although the article does not talk about her as much, Mrs. Cisco worked with her husband and continued their struggle after his passing.
With their neighbors the Ciscos worked to challenge segregation and inequality in their children's schools.
From 1895 to 1900, Black parents sued school officials twenty times and held a years-long boycott of Jamaica’s “colored school.” Black parents were willing to go to great lengths to secure an equal education for their children. Many of the Ciscos' neighbors were laborers, coachmen, servants, and janitors, and were afraid of losing their jobs because of their activism. Their employers, many of them white people, could have fired them for their participation.[^2]
Speaking to a reporter in 1896, Mr. Cisco explained: “I and my father and mother have paid taxes in Jamaica for eighty years, yet I am denied a place in the school near my house, while Irishmen, Italians and Dutchmen who have been here only three months, can go in these, although covered with dirt.[^3] I am a man of means in business here and yet on September 3, when my three children were sent to school where my neighbors’ children attend, they were put out and sent home crying. The colored school is three-fourth of a mile further away than the white School No. 3, and it is in the low swampy portion of the village and they are not taught as well as the children of the white schools.”[^4]
On this day in 1896, Judge Garrettson dismissed the charges against Mr. Cisco. Jamaica’s schools did not change their policy, and the Ciscos continued to challenge it. Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco was arrested three times for violating the school attendance law when she refused to send her children to segregated Black schools.
