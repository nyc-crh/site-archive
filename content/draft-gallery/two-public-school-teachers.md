In March 1925, The Survey Graphic published a special issue of the magazine. Alan Locke guest-edited the issue and wrote its introduction. He said the issue was meant "to document the New Negro culturally and socially,—to register the transformations of the inner and outer life of the Negro in America that have so significantly taken place in the last few years."[^1] The issue explores the "inner life of Harlem". It explained the origins of jazz and "Negro folk music" as well as the community’s "organizng social forces". It also touched on the conditions of the schools in the community. 
The edition, however, was more than just an analysis of the community. It was an important statement on how Black Harlemites understood themselves. As Alain Locke said, so much public discussion  ". . . is about the Negro rather than of him, so that it is the Negro problem rather than the Negro that is known ... in the general mind." Therefore, this magazine issue shows "self-portraiture" that "concentrated upon self-expression and the forces and motives of self-determination."[^2]
The portrait above is by Winhold Reiss. It captures "Two Public School Teachers", likely Lucile Spence and Melva Price. Both fought against segregated and racist schooling.[^3] They used their ole to advocate for issues like anti-racist textbooks, school integreation, and improved education facilities. They felt their role as educators went beyond teaching core subjects to helping students navigate a racist society. This portrait raises interesting questions given the issue’s focus on self expression and determination. How and why did these activist educators choose to present themselves in this manner?
