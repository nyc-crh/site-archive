On April 16, 1937 the Teachers Union of New York (TU) organized a conference that was held at Hotel Pennsylvania in Manhattan. They held the event to discuss problems they saw in their schools. They discussed the buildings falling apart as well as racism in schools. They centered their discussion around the idea that schools could only impvoe with attention to poverty and employment discrimination.[^1]
The Teachers Union began in 1916 with 600 teachers. By the late 1930s, its membership totaled 6,500. The TU had several issues they pushed for in schools. They anted academic freedom, equal educational opportunities for all students, and a truthful present of African American life and history. They knew these issues would require broader social change, so they also championed radical social and economic reforms.[^2]
Lucile Spence was a Black biology teacher at Harlem’s Wadleigh School. As one of the few Black teachers in NYC she helped found the TU’s Harlem Committee. The new committee hoped their brad view of school reform would improve students’ academic achievement. They ultimately wanted building repairs, more Black teachers, and the greater incorporation of Black history into the curriculum. The hope was that these changes would help challenge discriminiation in the schools and lead to better experiences for the Black students of Harlem. Spence was the committee’s chairman and pushed for the organization to work with local religious groups and families. 
Between 1935 and 1937, Spence’s work with TU’s Harlem Committee brought greater attention to Harlem’s schools. It also helped build new organizations focused on improving educational opportunities for Black students in Harlem. For instance, in March 1936 TU sponsored a meeting at St. Martin’s Church in Harlem. Held a year after the “Harlem Riot” of 1935, it led to the establishment of the Permanent Committee for Better Schools in Harlem (PCBSH). Spence became the secretary of this organization. In January 1937, they staged a mock trial or “People’s Trial” of the New York City Board of Education. The changes were dscirimination and neglect of school children in Harlem. The jury, composed of prominent community members, found the Board of Education guilty on all charges. They urged Mayor Fiorella LaGuardia to reconvene his Commission on the Harlem Riot to investigate school conditions in Harlem.[^3]
The meeting mentioned in the article above took place three months after the "People’s Trial". It was organized by Lucile Spence and the TU. The article highlights the speech of Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. However, it’s important to note that it was Spence who organized the event and played a critical and sustained role in bringing attention to issues in Harlem’s schools. Spence combined her work in the classroom with her activism to bring attention to racism in Harlem. She felt that the  "school conditions in Harlem violate[d] the principles of democracy and [were] creating fertile ground for the seeds of race prejudice."[^4]
