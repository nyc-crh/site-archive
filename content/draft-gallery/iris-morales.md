questions:
  - Does the political education class in the picture look like classrooms in your school? What's similar? What's different?
  - What made the Young Lords' political education classes different than traditional schoolrooms? Why might that have been effective?
  - As noted above, many of the Young Lords Party members were illiterate, what resources did the party provide to its members so they could meaningfully participate in these political education classes? How might the centering of learner needs like this impacted the party?
  - If you were working with your peers to create a learning space for one another, what would it look like?

Born in 1948, Iris Morales was the child of Puerto Rican migrants to New York. Morales’ political development began when she was young and saw the barriers her parents faced as immigrants. “As a child of migrants,” she would later recall, “we don’t speak the language, we don’t know how to navigate the court system, we don’t know how to access our rights.” Morales also learned the depths of inequality created by segregation by watching “the horrific TV images of the civil rights movement,”. She grew up discussing the movement with her friends in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She also acted in a school play produced by an NAACP youth group. Later on she participated in the 1964 student boycott of New York City’s schools and worked as a tenants’ rights organizer.[^1]

Iris Morales saw crucial parallels between Puerto Rican and Black New Yorkers’ struggle against segregation. She believed there was a common cause between the two groups. When Morales arrived as a freshman at City College, she joined ONYX, the Black student organization. There was no Puerto Rican political organization on campus. However, it didn’t take long for Morales to join a group that led to the creation of Puerto Ricans Involved in Student Action.  This group sought to establish Puerto Rican Studies in the school.[^2]

Morales brought her own experiences and used her organizing talents to help expand the Young Lords party. She played a critical role in the growth and success of the group’s political education program. As another Young Lord recalled, Morales “was sharp, she was able to absorb ideas and break down so that anyone could understand them.”[^3] This ability to make knowledge accessible was critical to the success of the political education classes.

Historian Johanna Fernández wrote a groundbreaking history on the Young Lords Party. She says that “For many Puerto Ricans, education had been fraught with trauma and social rejection they endured as children in New York public schools. The sense that it was meaningless led many members of the organization to drop out of school.” As a result, many of the party’s members were illiterate. However, Morales, in collaboration with Juan Gonzalez, established a political education program. It combined college-level reading material on structural inequality with discussions of their own shared experiences. Members shared their experiences being demeaned for speaking Spanish. They spoke of being tokenized in other educational programs. The collective analyses of these experiences, alongside communal reading and discussion, was the backbone of the program. The creation of this collective educational space outside the bounds of a traditional classroom demonstrates yet again how Black and Latina women have sought to challenge segregated and unequal schooling.
