in our Nation's Capital will take place on Wednesday,
August 28, in the Maroh on Washington for
Jobs and Freedom.
This action is designed to focus nationwide attention
on the plight of millions of Negro Americans
100 years after ~anc1pat1on and to press for a
redress of their intolerable grievances in the
present session of the Congress.
On behalf of the sponsors of the March: James
Farmer, Reverend Dr. f&artin Luther King, Jr.,
John Lewis, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, Mathew
Ahmann, Reverend Eugene Carson Blake, Rabbi

Joachin Prinz, Welter Reuther, and myself, I
have been authorized to request an appointment
with you on that date.
It is our hope that the sponsoring committee will
be afforded an opportunity at such a conference
to discuss the program of the March and plans for
its implementation by your Administration and
Congress.
In view of the schedule of activities for that date,
11we would be deeply gratified if such a conference
1could be arranged for 10:30 A.M. on August 28.
Very respectfully,
