The School Boycott Concept
By DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING. JR.
(President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference)
In recent weeks, with increasing
persistence, news media personnel
and many friends of • the
nonviolent movement have raised
what I believe to be sincere questions
about the school-boycott
concept. The query
usually hinges on
whether boycotting
srhools is the "wise \
approach" to com- ti
bat the continued
existence of de facto
school segregation
as it exists in
m a n y Northern
communities. DR. KING
Let me say at the beginning
that I heartily endorse the schoolboycott
concept. It is, to me, one
of the most creative nonviolent
methods developed to date on the
Northern scene to dramatize the
intolerable conditions that are
the results of de facto segregation
in the public schools. The schoolboycott
concept in practice has
proved very effective in uncovering
the injustice and indignity
that school children in
the Negro-Puerto Rican minority
community face.
More than anything else, it
has unveiled the naked truth
that segregation and discrimination
are. not inherently sectional
problems. There is no quarter of
• this nation that can boast entirely
of clean hands on the matter of
racial justice. School boycotts
.nave punctured the thin veneer
of the North's racial self•
righteousness. In short, the
school-boycott concept is legitimate
because it is nonviolently 1
creative, dramatic cond powerful.
One of the chief reservations
expressed in reference to the
school boycott is that "children
ought not be involved in an adult
problem." The disciples of pessimism
voiced this same sentiment
during the mass protest in
Birmingham. Our answer rationale
remains exactly t h e
same: Children of this generation
stand to be the ones most
affected • by the system and for
the longest period of time. If they
are to bear the scars of an unjust
and immoral society, they
have a legitimate right and
duty to participate in the process
that can potentially free them
from the blight of a segregated
society. The leading psychologists
in our nation are in unanlmous
agreement that the system of
segregation has a negative effect
on both the white man and the
Negro. It erroneously gives to
the segregated a false sense of
inferiority and to the segregator
a false sense of superiority. Thi?
argument that children should
not bear the brunt of the struggle
which holds promise of
brightening all their tomorrows,
is shallow, at best.
There are others who argue
that the school boycotts will
possibly alienate some of our
allies in the struggle. They offer
the weak apology that with "all
the progress" that has been
made, the school boycotts have
a quality of "untimeliness." This
was the character of some of the
dissent surrounding the school
boycott earlier this year in New
York City. The truth of the matter
is that it is not untimeliness
at all-rather, it is only the reaping
of the harvest of past apathy
to tragic conditions that were
allowed to e)dst without any
serious concern. Two years prior
to the boycott, community leaders
and agencies called to the
attention of the city fathers the
deep entrenchment of de facto
segregation in public education.
Yet, with ample forewarning of
community discontent, at the
time of the first boycott this year,
school statistics revealed that
43% of all elementary and Jr.
high schools had a marked racial
imbalance. What more creative
recourse could be found to shake
the world's largest city out of
its lethargy on so critical a
moral and social issue than the
school-boycott concept?
An final word might be· said to
protect the usefulness of . this
creative device. We must always
guard against the indiscriminate
use of this or any nonviolent
technique. The school-boycott is
a technique used best at the most
strategic and dramatic moment
and is properly applied only when
the aggrieved parties have exhausted
all attempts at satisfactory
conciliation. Utilized within
this frame of reference, the
school-boycott concept will prove
in the days to come to be one of
,the most effective ways to elimi.
nate the high incidence of de
facto school segregation in the
North. The results that it can
achieve will make hollow the
• present harsh criticism that seeks
to invalidate its justification and
its legitimacy.
