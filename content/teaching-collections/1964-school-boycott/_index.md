On February 3, 1964, approximately 464,000 young people  boycotted school in protest of segregation and inequality. This was roughly half of New York City’s public school students. At that time, it was the largest mass protest ever conducted in the United States. This monumental event often goes unmentioned and unstudied when we learn about the Civil Rights Movement. This silence obscures the activism of young people in the struggle against segregation and inequality in the North. These documents trace a longer history of organizing and activism against segregated schools. It looks at the connection between struggles in the North and South and shows how “color-blind” policies provided cover for racism and segregation. This document set tells a story about the 1964 boycott that recognizes the boycott as a singular event of immense importance while putting it into context with the broader system of segregation and a greater struggle for freedom.

The following year, Reverend Milton Galamison and several parents and teachers groups launched a boycott of the "600" schools. New York City’s “600” schools were established in the 1940s to educate “socially maladjusted” and “delinquent” youth. Their original purpose was to reform young people who had “lost their way.” By the 1960s the schools began labeling students as “socially maladjusted” and or “emotionally disturbed”—what we would call emotional or mental health disabilities today. Some of the "600" schools were housed in institutions like jails, and hospitals, but most were called "day schools" and were created only for students with mental health and/or emotional disabilities that impacted their ability to learn.

Despite their stated purpose, the "600" schools looked like another way to segregate students by race. The vast majority of "600" school students were Black and Puerto Rican and most came from poor neighborhoods. Students were referred to the schools by school personnel, which was sometimes influenced by racism. Some had difficult family lives and others had learning or intellectual disabilities that were not identified, so they didn't get the kind of educational support they needed. By the 1960s, the NYC Board of Education started building new "600" schools to keep up with "demand" for space to educate these students. But the quality of general education was often very poor. Students fell behind academically and were not expected to succeed. They felt that many of the students were "bright" but bored in their classes, which led to behavior problems. Against the backdrop of the fight for desegregation, the "600" schools and the issue of “disruptive youth” played an important role in the fight for community control and the historic 1968 Teachers’ Strike.
