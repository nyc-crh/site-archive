This document set explores Black and Latina women’s education advocacy through and beyond the courts from the late nineteenth century to the present. There are five parts to this set. The first involves a school desegregation case brought against the School Board of Queens by Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco in 1899. The second is a collection of primary sources that illuminate segregationist school zoning policies in Harlem and its surrounding neighborhoods as well as the key roles Black women, like Lucile Spence and Eunice Hunton Carter, played in challenging those policies during the first half of the twentieth century. The third part is a series of documents crucial to understanding the story of the “Harlem Nine” - the nine Harlem mothers who refused to send their children to segregated and unequal schools in 1958. The next part examines the educational activism of Denise Oliver and Iris Morales within the Young Lords Party. The final part narrates the multi-faceted advocacy of Evelina López Antonetty in the Bronx.

The different groups of documents illuminate policies of segregation and the multiple ways Black and Latina women challenged them. As you read through these resources, you’ll identify important similarities, like the use of law enforcement against women who refused to send their children to segregated schools. You’ll also notice differences, such as the various organizations parents and teachers worked through to challenge segregation. Yet, the connective thread in all these stories is how the ideas, labor, and leadership of Black and Latina women have been central to fighting segregation in New York.
As you read and analyze the sources within this document set, you may pay particular attention to the portraits in each part. These images draw our attention to representation - meaning how people present themselves to others and how they are represented by others. How do the different women in these portraits choose to represent themselves? Or, who had what power to shape the portraits?

Each of these Black and Latina women activists lived within the structures of a racist, patriarchal, and capitalist society. Scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw provided the term “intersectionality” to describe the ways racism, sexism, classism, and other forms of discrimination intersect, interact, and overlap with one another. For example, Black women face both racism and sexism not as separate challenges, but in connection with one another. Recognizing these interlocking oppressions raises questions about how these women pursued their advocacy, how they navigated obstacles, how they chose to represent themselves, and how others chose to represent them.

Although histories of the Civil Rights Movement tend to emphasize charismatic, male leadership, especially that of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., women’s leadership was critical to organizing and sustaining larger movements. As this document set shows, the ingenuity and educational visions of Black and Latina women activists in New York illuminates this fact as well as the longer history of struggle for educational justice.
