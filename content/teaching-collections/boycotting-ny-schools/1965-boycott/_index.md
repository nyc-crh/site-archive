In 1965, Reverend Milton Galamison and several parents and teachers groups launched a boycott of the "600" schools. New York City’s “600” schools were established in the 1940s to educate “socially maladjusted” and “delinquent” youth. Their original purpose was to reform young people who had “lost their way.” By the 1960s the schools began labeling students as “socially maladjusted” and or “emotionally disturbed”—what we would call emotional or mental health disabilities today. Some of the "600" schools were housed in institutions like jails, and hospitals, but most were called "day schools" and were created only for students with mental health and/or emotional disabilities that impacted their ability to learn.
