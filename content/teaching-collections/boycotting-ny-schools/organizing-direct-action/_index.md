The New York City school boycotts built on a long tradition of mass protest in U.S. history, including labor strikes and civil rights actions in the South like the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the lunch-counter sit-ins. These major actions required extensive work in advance and behind the scenes. Leaders helped build solidarity, at times across people who had different interests or had not previously worked together. They also had to figure out how major events with tens or even hundreds of thousands of people would work. Who would go where, what would they do, who would speak, how would everyone stay safe? The networks and strategies that earlier organizers cultivated helped make the New York City school boycotts possible.
