White New Yorkers were relentless in opposing desegregation. Even very small-scale attempts by the Board of Education to desegregate schools - like programs that involved shifting only a few hundred Black students to majority white schools - prompted protests and backlash.[^1] The white media also responded to civil rights organizing critically, calling the boycott "tragically misguided." Polls conducted by the New York Times showed that 57 percent of New Yorkers thought the civil rights movement had gone too far and was moving "too fast" - even though New York had made almost no progress on school desegregation.[^2]
