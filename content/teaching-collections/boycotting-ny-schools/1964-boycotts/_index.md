In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that segregated schools were unconstitutional. Activists like Ella Baker, Mae Mallory, Lucile Spence, and Kenneth Clark had worked tirelessly to desegregate the city’s schools starting in the 1930s. However, city and school officials used a variety of tactics to sustain segregation.

In 1959, Milton Galamison was the pastor at Siloam Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn. Galamison founded the Parents Workshop for Equality, which stated its objective as "work[ing] for the integration of the schools of New York; for full and equal opportunity for learning for all the children of our city; to end all school discrimination against Negro and Puerto Rican children; and to preserve, improve, and expand our free and democratic public school system.”[^1]

Galamison and the Parents Workshop were major forces in making the 1964 school boycott happen. Galamison asked Bayard Rustin to organize the demonstration and he played a key role in drawing media attention to segregation in New York’s schools. However, the success of the Parents’ Workshop rested upon the dedication and coordination of the organization’s offices spread throughout neighborhoods in Brooklyn. In particular, the leadership of women like Thelma Johnson sustained the organizations and their efforts. They recruited parents for the Workshop by going door to door, planned meetings, created informational materials, and organized demonstrations. On the day of the boycott, they ran phone lines, deployed guards and volunteers, and ensured that the day was a massive, but peaceful, demonstration across the city. Their leadership and connection with parents in the community created the networks that made the boycott possible.
