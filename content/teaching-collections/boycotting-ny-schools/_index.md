In 1964, New York’s schools were highly segregated and unequal. It was ten years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision that declared school segregation to be unconstitutional, but little had changed in New York City classrooms. Many decisions made by the Board of Education helped segregate New York City’s schools: which students were zoned or assigned to which schools, where schools were built or not built, which teachers were assigned to which schools, and how students were grouped or divided within classrooms and schools. Segregation in other parts of the city - including housing and employment - contributed to school segregation as well. Segregation came with and worsened educational inequality. New York schools with more Black and Latinx students were more likely to be overcrowded, to have less-qualified teachers, to have poor facilities, and to see fewer students graduate, for example.  

New Yorkers seeking educational justice used school boycotts as a way to protest segregation and the inequality that came with it. During boycotts, students chose not to attend school, or parents kept their children home, and some activists organized alternative “freedom schools” for children. Mae Mallory and the “Harlem Nine” [document set link here] had used this tactic in 1958, to protest segregation in Harlem schools. But on February 3, 1964, there was a massive boycott that reached across the city. An estimated 464,000 young people - roughly half of New York City’s public school students, including many Black, Latinx, and white students  - boycotted school in protest of segregation and inequality. At that time, it was the largest mass protest ever conducted in the United States.[^1] The boycotts continued, on a smaller scale, in March 1964 and January 1965, and they prompted major counter-protests as well.

Given how many students from across New York City participated in the February 3, 1964 “Freedom Day” boycott, it is likely that students with a variety of disabilities were part of the protest. It may also be the case that some who wanted to participate were not able to. The existing documentation of that boycott makes it hard to be sure.
Despite the massive scale of the February 1964 boycott, and the repeated use of this kind of protest in schools in New York City and around the country, the New York City school boycotts often get left out of histories of the US civil rights movement. The history of the boycotts explored here shows the activism of young people in the struggle for educational justice in the North. And it illustrates how white opposition to desegregation worked in New York City, both among “conservative” white parents and those who thought of themselves as “liberal.”[^2]

Historians like Jeanne Theoharis and Matt Delmont, and teachers like Adam Sanchez, have helped bring more attention to the largest 1964 New York City boycott.[^3] Yet in their work, there is little discussion of another boycott - the 1965 boycott, which focused in part on how disabled youth, or youth that the school system labeled as disabled, experienced racist and ableist segregation. Historian Francine Almash is working to correct that silence. She studies the 1965 boycott, and notices how the white press, Black community members and organizers, and white educators responded to this attention to disability as part of segregation. Why did so many resist making disability and students labeled as disabled a part of their desegregation advocacy? And she asks why earlier histories of the boycotts have left out this important part of the story.[^4]  

After the boycotts of 1964 and 1965, students, parents, and activists continued to use boycotts as one tool to protest educational injustice in New York City.
