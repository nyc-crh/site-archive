### Coming Soon

The New York City Civil Rights History Project (NYCCRHP) is an in-progress collaborative effort between:

- youth and adult activists,
- scholars,
- educators,
- public history organizations.

The project was inspired by New York City high school student activists who wanted to understand the history of their city and schools. We aim to build a 6-12 grade teaching resource that explores histories of racist and ableist segregation in our schools. And, to tell about the persistent effort of community activists to challenge it and seek educational justice for all students.
