workonproject: "The NYCCRHP's presentation of the 1965 boycotts depends heavily on Francine's research. Francine identified key sources related to the boycotts and helped craft our interpretation of them and the 600 schools. Her dissertation, \"Out of the Shadows: Recovering the History of the New York City \'600\' Schools,\" offers the first historical interpretation of race and disability in New York City schools."
