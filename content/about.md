Welcome to the New York City Civil Rights History Project. As educators, scholars, activists, and students, we chose this project name because many New York City teachers and students already recognize that the civil rights movement in the US is important to teach and learn about. But students often receive only a limited, and therefore incorrect, representation of this history. We hope the name of this site is an invitation to think about something familiar in a new way.

We want to emphasize how education has been a central site of struggle for civil rights in the U.S. We want to ensure that often-overlooked struggles for disability rights are included in civil rights history, and that struggles for disability rights by disabled people of color are not further erased or marginalized. People of color and disabled people have used the courts, mass protest, and many other strategies to win recognition of their rights in the law. We want to recognize that women and young people of color were civil rights leaders and should be central to how we think about civil rights history. 

Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (or IDEA) (1975), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) were crucial steps in naming and protecting the rights of students of color and disabled students. Even if each of the civil rights recognized in these decisions and laws were always respected, injustices could still continue.

Justice is a broader, more ambitious, word than rights. It includes but looks beyond rights to consider peoples’ humanity, their dreams, their aspirations, and their power to shape their own lives. Working for justice involves solidarity, support, and connections within and across communities. Sins Invalid, a disability justice organization led by disabled people of color, says that “This is disability justice”: “All bodies are unique and essential. All bodies are whole. All bodies have strengths and needs that must be met. We are powerful not despite the complexities of our bodies, but because of them. We move together, with no body left behind.” The NYC Coalition for Educational Justice states that “Students deserve a quality public education that honors their cultures, backgrounds, and communities.” We are motivated by these and other historic visions of justice.

We believe students can better understand their city and schools, and expand their own power to make changes in our world, when they have a robust understanding of the history of fights for educational justice in NYC. 

We carefully selected the primary sources included in this website to reflect recent historical research about racism, disability, and education in New York City. The primary sources here help teach a set of key concepts we list and explain below.

Yet we recognize that these sources represent only a fragment of the full histories of race and disability within NYC schools. Many important topics and stories have yet to be included. We hope that our resources inspire teachers and students to learn more, and that this website serves as a starting point. As historical interpretations are always changing, because they are revised through new evidence, observations, and insights, we ask you to think of this site as work always in progress.

Throughout this site, we use terms such as “disability” and “race” inclusively. This means that when we identify people by a racial category—such as Black or white, for example—that category encompasses all people within that category, including disabled and nondisabled people, people of different genders and sexualities, and other markers of identity. Likewise, when we speak of disabled people, this includes people of a variety of racial categories, genders, sexualities, and more.
